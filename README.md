# Dirt.Collections

Dirt.Collections is a library with an assortment of various collection implementations, often esoteric in nature.

Frequently, the collections will be more experimentation than anything, especially those that are bringing in patterns found in other languages.

Maybe some of these will even be useful.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. If adding a new collection, please consider:

- Adding tests
- Implementing appropriate interfaces for your collection
- Avoiding new dependencies

Keep in mind that your contributions will be distributed as open-source under the MIT license.
